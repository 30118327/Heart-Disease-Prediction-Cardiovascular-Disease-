Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels and remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to the American Heart Association, CVDs were responsible for nearly 18 million deaths globally in 2019, accounting for about 32% of all deaths (World Health Organization, 2021). Of these, approximately 85% were caused by heart attacks and strokes, with a significant 38% occurring in individuals under the age of 70.

Given this alarming impact, early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and managing cardiovascular conditions effectively. Machine learning techniques offer promising capabilities for identifying individuals at risk by uncovering complex patterns in clinical data. In this notebook, I develop a Gradient Boosting model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease and use Shapley values to interpret the model by identifying the most influential predictors contributing to its predictions.
